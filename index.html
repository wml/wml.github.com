      <h1>Innovation thrives at the intersection of Technology and Leadership</h1>
      <p>
	Only the best leaders can build teams capable of keeping pace with the
	accelerating rate of innovation. It takes passion, deep technical 
	knowledge, and a genuine interest in others to untap the potential
	locked away in most technology teams. It takes those same qualities 
	to attract and retain the best engineering talent. I embrace this
	philosophy with energy and focus in every team I build.
      </p>

      <h1>Perspective and Experience drive Results</h1>
      <p>
	With over 10 years of diverse experience across several industries and 
	technology stacks, I've seen what works, what doesn't, and when. In the
	dynamic business environment of a lean start-up, results 
	necessitate iterating with disciplined simplicity and a nuanced 
	understanding of what's likely to come. Only by embracing change,
	introspecting, and cultivating a deep thirst for learning can a
	team gain the perspective required to make good decisions in conditions
	of extreme uncertainty.
      </p>

      <h2>Yodle, Inc.</h2>
      <p>
	My cross-functional team of five software engineers delivered several
	key digital marketing innovations, among them mobile-optimized landing pages, a 
	website-integrated mobile review solicitation app for Android and 
	iPhone, a Facebook-integrated social promotions widget, and a
	restructuring of Yodle's core product offerings including the addition
	of a low-cost, highly-performant entry-level SEO product. We
	successfully increased the performance of the product in terms of 
	qualified leads by 4X over the previous offering at the same price 
	point, effectively reducing the cost per call to our clients by 75% (a
	key high-level performance metric associated with client retention and
	company profitibility.)
      </p>

      <h2>Bank of America Merrill Lynch</h2>
      <p>
	In order to tackle the issue of lost revenue and trade expediency due to
	client connectivity misconfigurations, I led a small team of java 
	engineers in designing and implementing a centralized configuration 
	management system. The connectivity system pushed much of the complexity
	usually found in the application layer down into XML configuration files
	which were edited by hand and deployed on an ad-hoc basis. This
        error-prone process regularly resulted in costly downtime for clients.
	The new system provides an easy-to-use GUI for editing
	client configurations, validation, and a standardized, auditable 
	deployment mechanism. With the first release alone, the operational 
	losses realized from misconfigurations were reduced ten-fold.
      </p>

      <h2>Hillier Architecture</h2>
      <p>
	As an in-house developer, I created several applications in support of
	the planning, execution and monitoring of large architecture projects.
	The most innovative project was an interactive Punchlist application 
	designed for the first generation of Windows tablets. Architects would
	leverage the app's video-capture, speech and handwriting recognition to
	document construction flaws in rugged external environments where a
	traditional keyboard would be difficult to use, automatically generating
	a report from the data collected on-site upon return to the office.
